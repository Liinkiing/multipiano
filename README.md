# Multipiano

![Preview](https://multipiano.netlify.app/socials.png)

A vuejs application which allow users to play piano with friends in realtime!

You can test it here: https://multipiano.netlify.app (first request is sometimes long because I have a free plan in Heroku, 
so my dynos have to wake up ðŸ˜´)

The appearance is not finished, but a lot of the features I've wanted to includes are available, it's just not polished.

You can 
- Play with your MIDI controller / keyboard / mouse
- Change the piano sound (currently 2 available piano type)
- Create a room
- Manage room options
  - Enable / Disable chat
  - Enable / Disable room visibility
  - Kick / Ban / Unban players
- Chat with your friends and edit your messages (double click on one of your message to edit it, or press `arrow up` when in chat to edit last message)
- Change your username by double clicking on your badge
- Change your color

It's not finished and is more used for me as a test. I've wanted to mimic [http:/multiplayerpiano.com](http:/multiplayerpiano.com) in terms of features, for learning purposes
